Understanding Data Science and Machine Learning Algorithms using Python

Below is a General Overview of the Project, more detailed details of each parts are found in the Jupiter notebook of the Folder. 

# Part zero
## Data Analysis Overview
- the goal of this section is to determine if a company that sells movie tickets (in this case Fandango) had bias rating system in order to sell more tickets in 2015. to achive this we must analyze, understand and find Relationship between various movie ticket seller's data in the year 2015.
- To get better undertanding on the problem statement: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/
- Datasets used was gotten from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango
- Libraries used : NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, SeaBorn.

# Part one
## Linear Regression 
- The goal of this Section is to train a model on Historical Housing Data so that when provided a future House Data with similar Features the model was trained on, it can predict the price the new house will sell for. 
- Historical Dataset **Ames Iowa Data Set**: http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf
- Linear Regression models used:
    Simple Linear Regression,
    Polynomial regression,
    ElasticNet.
- Library : SciKit Learn
