# Machine Learning
Understanding Data Science and Machine Learning Algorithms using Python

Below is a General Overview of All Machine Learning Projects contained in the repo, more detailed details of each projects are found in the included Jupiter notebook. 

# Part zero
## Data Analysis Overview
- the goal of this section is to determine if a company that sells movie tickets (in this case Fandango) had bias rating system in order to sell more tickets in 2015. to achive this we must analyze, understand and find Relationship between various movie ticket seller's data in the year 2015.
- To get better undertanding on the problem statement: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/
- Datasets used was gotten from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango
- Libraries used : NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, SeaBorn.

# Part one
## Linear Regression 
- The goal of this Section is to train a model on Historical Housing Data so that when provided a future House Data with similar Features the model was trained on, it can predict the price the new house will sell for. 
- Historical Dataset **Ames Iowa Data Set**: http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf
- Linear Regression CV model
- Library : SciKit Learn

# Part two
## Logistic Regression 
- The goal of this Section is to Create a Classification Model that can predict whether or not a person has presence of heart disease based on physical features of that person (age,sex, cholesterol, etc...) 
- Dataset **Heart Disease**: [http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
- Logistic Regression CV model.
- Library : SciKit Learn
